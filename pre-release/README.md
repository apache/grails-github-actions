# Handles Tag updates to ensure the Release Version is set

A GitHub action that handles any pre-release steps as part of a GitHub release process.  This includes: 

1. Updating the `projectVersion` or `version` in `gradle.properties` to match the tag version.
2. Optionally running an additional script as part of the `projectVersion` change to transform files in the repository.
3. Commiting changes from 1 & 2 above and force pushing an update to the tag.
4. Moving the release back from `draft` to `published` because of the tag update.

Please note that this action allows users to simply create a GitHub release and this action handles matching the version of the GitHub release to the checked in version.

## Requirements

1. Requires the permission `contents: write` to update the tag & release.

## Environment Variables
* (required) `RELEASE_VERSION` - The version of the release being created.
* (optional) `RELEASE_TAG_PREFIX` - The prefix of the release tag. If not set, it will default to `v` (e.g., `v1.0.0`).
* (optional) `RELEASE_SCRIPT_PATH` - An optional path to a custom shell script that will be executed after the version replacement in `gradle.properties`, but prior to commiting the project changes.

## Example Usage

Basic Usage:
```yaml
      - name: '⚙️ Run pre-release'
        uses: apache/grails-github-actions/pre-release@asf
        env:
          RELEASE_VERSION: ${{ steps.release_version.outputs.value }}
```

Running a custom script `myScript.sh` that's checked in under `.github/scripts`:
```yaml
      - name: '⚙️ Run pre-release'
        uses: apache/grails-github-actions/pre-release@asf
        env:
          RELEASE_VERSION: ${{ steps.release_version.outputs.value }}
          RELEASE_SCRIPT_PATH: '.github/scripts/myScript.sh'
```
