## Introduction

This repository hosts GitHub Actions that power the release workflows for Apache Grails & related projects. 

Actions include:
1. `pre-release` - handles setting the project version based on the Git tag & running various pre-release tasks.
2. `deploy-github-pages` - handles publishing documentation to GitHub Pages for both snapshots & releases.
3. `post-release` - assists in merging tagged changes back to the target branch & bumping to the next development version.
4. `export-gradle-properties` - exposes selected Gradle properties as environment variables.

## Who can use these actions

These actions are meant to assist in using the GitHub `Release` feature to produce a published release. They were primarily designed for Gradle projects that need to set a version & automate parts of the release process such as the changing of the project version & publishing documentation.
