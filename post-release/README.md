# Handles Repository Setup for the next Release Version

A GitHub Action that handles steps necessary to close out a GitHub Release process.  This includes: 

1. Creating a branch of named like `merge-back-TAGNAME` that will:
    * Include the tag changes to prevent orphaned changes.
    * Include changing the version in `gradle.properties` or `version` to the next version. 
2. Optionally closing the current milestone associated with the release.
3. Optionally running an additional script as part of the close process to transform files in the repository.

Please note that the next version is derived from the provided `RELEASE_VERSION` using a script that assumes a [Semantic Version](https://semver.org/).

## Requirements

1. Github Actions must be allowed to create pull requests in the repository. You can configure this in the repository settings under "Actions" -> "General" -> "Workflow permissions".
2. Requires the permission `contents: write` to create a branch and commit changes to the repository.
3. Optionally requires the permission `pull-requests: write` to open the pull request to merge back changes from the tag. If this permission is not set, a Pull Request will not be created.
4. Optionally requires the permission `issues: write` if milestone closing is required.

## Environment Variables
* (optional) `RELEASE_VERSION` - The version of the release being closed. If not set, it will be derived from the `GITHUB_REF`, which as part of a release will be the tag name.
* (optional) `RELEASE_TAG_PREFIX` - The prefix of the release tag. If not set, it will default to `v` (e.g., `v1.0.0`).
* (optional) `RELEASE_SCRIPT_PATH` - An optional path to a custom shell script that will be executed after the version replacement in `gradle.properties`, but prior to commiting the project changes.

## Example Usage

Basic Usage:
```yaml
      - name: "⚙️ Run post-release"
        uses: apache/grails-github-actions/post-release@asf
```

Running a custom script `myScript.sh` that's checked in under `.github/scripts`:
```yaml
      - name: "⚙️ Run post-release"
        uses: apache/grails-github-actions/post-release@asf
        env:
          RELEASE_SCRIPT_PATH: '.github/scripts/myScript.sh'
```
